<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goals of this website is the maximise the outreach Cossieplay has to the community, and particularly younger people. The youth of today are very excited to participate in cosplaying and this website will allow them to fulfil their cosplay needs. This site will allow CossiePlay to rapidly grow and expand their reach around the city and is the most effective way of allowing growth within this small business. The creation of this website will not only help CossiePlay grow financially, but will allow it to grow and impact the community in a meaningful way so that cosplayers across the region can gladly express themselves and expand their connections as they meet other cosplayers. </p>
<p>In summary our goals are to:</p>
<p>- Provide CossiePlay with a more extended reach in the community through the website. This will greatly increase the attendance at the monthly parties. </p>
<p>- Increase sales numbers for CossiePlay due to increased interest. </p>
<p>- Increase general interest in cosplaying in the community. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The processes in which the site's success will be evaluated will be by measuring the attendance of cosplayers at the monthly parties, both before and after the implementation of the website. Using this data we can input it into a line graph to see a trend which will therefore determine the impact that the creation of this website had on the numbers of people who found out about CossiePlay.</p>
<p>Another method of doing this can be by observing the financial statistics of CossiePlay both before and after the creation of this website. As aforementioned this data will be 	inputed into a line graph to observe the trends which will measure the success of this website in increasing the outreach of CossiePlay and expanding on their small consumer base.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience of this website will be for younger people aged 14-20. These people are evidently the most interested in cosplay in current society. By viewing the main theme of cosplay, in modern society, it is obvious that cosplay is mainly inspired around 'anime' (Japanese animations/cartoons) and gaming culture. Many young people want to dress up as their favourite anime hero, villian or videogame character. Because of this, it is obvious that targetting an audience of people of the ages 14-20 will be ideal as these people are the most in touch with the cosplay culture that has dominated our society.</p>
<p>This website will have a unique design which will appeal to these younger people. By utilising bright colours and making the website interactive, younger people will be more drawn in and compelled to stay on the site. This will have a domino effect of these younger people interacting with all of what the site has to offer and will immerse them into what CossiePlay is. Therefore since the sites interaction will appeal to these younger audiences, they will find themselves compelled to purchase cosplay and attend the monthly parties in which they will meet other fellow cosplayers and will make friends in CossiePlay, which will compel these people to stay. </p>
